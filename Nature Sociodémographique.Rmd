### 1. Study of the outliers
The analysis of the graphs leads to detect outliers that strongly influence the results. First we will describe these outliers and then we will suppress them from the analysis.
Looking at the graph, we can note that 504 particular individuals strongly contribute to the construction of the plane. The cumulative contribution of these individuals to the construction of the plane equals **26.8%**.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.5}
drawn <-
integer(0)
par(mar = c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 2.1))
plot.MCA(memory, choix = 'ind', invisible = c('var', 'quali'), select = drawn, title = '', cex = cex)
```

*The factors in red are considered as active whereas those in green are illustrative.*
*The labeled variables are those the best shown on the plane.*

### 2. Inertia distribution
The inertia of the first dimensions shows if there are strong relationships between variables and suggests the number of dimensions that should be studied.

The first two dimensions of analyse express **27.11%** of the total dataset inertia ; that means that 27.11% of the individuals (or variables) cloud total variability is explained by the plane.
This is a small percentage and the first plane just represents a part of the data variability.
This value is greater than the reference value that equals **26.01%**, the variability explained by this plane is thus significant
(the reference value is the 0.95-quantile of the inertia percentages distribution obtained by simulating 428 data tables of equivalent size on the basis of a uniform distribution).

From these observations, it is interesting to consider the next dimensions which also express a high percentage of the total inertia.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.5}
par(mar = c(2.6, 4.1, 1.1, 2.1))
ggplot2::ggplot(cbind.data.frame(x=1:nrow(res$eig),y=res$eig[,2])) + ggplot2::aes(x=x, y=y)+ ggplot2::geom_col(fill="blue") + ggplot2::xlab("Dimension") + ggplot2::ylab("Percentage of variance") + ggplot2::ggtitle("Decomposition of the total inertia") + ggplot2::theme_light() + ggplot2::theme(plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(hjust =0.5)) + ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:nrow(res$eig))
```

**Figure 2 - Decomposition of the total inertia**

An estimation of the right number of axis to interpret suggests to restrict the analysis to the description of the first 2 axis.
These axis present an amount of inertia greater than those obtained by the 0.95-quantile of random distributions (27.11% against 26.01%).
This observation suggests that only these axis are carrying a real information.
As a consequence, the description will stand to these axis.

### 3. Description of the plane 1:2

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.5}
par(mar = c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 2.1))
res.MCA<-MCA(entrain_valid[1:19][,-c(8,10,12,13,16,17,18)],quanti.sup=c(1,12),quali.sup=c(2,3,4,5,6,7),graph=FALSE)
plot.MCA(res.MCA,select= 'contrib 10342',selectMod= 'contrib  4 ',habillage='contrib',col.quali.sup='#006400',title="Nature Sociodémographique",cex=0.8,cex.main=0.8,cex.axis=0.8,label ='none')
```

**Figure 3.1 - Individuals factor map (MCA)**

The Wilks test p-value indicates which variable factors are the best separated on the plane (i.e. which one explain the best the distance between individuals).
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.5}
wilks.p <-
c(scolarite_avant = 0, langue = 1.84306797281362e-180, scol_mere = 1.05234911629255e-109, 
scol_pere = 2.29544825572497e-106, minorite_visible = 1.58150246420309e-83, 
genre = 5.0627955253176e-06)
wilks.p
```
The best qualitative variable to illustrate the distance between individuals on this plane is : *scolarite_avant*.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5.5}
sample = sample(rownames(res$call$X), length(rownames(res$call$X)))
res$call$X = res$call$X[sample,]
res$ind$coord = res$ind$coord[sample[!sample %in% rownames(res$ind.sup$coord)],]
res$ind.sup$coord = res$ind.sup$coord[sample[sample %in% rownames(res$ind.sup$coord)],]
drawn <-
integer(0)
hab <-
"scolarite_avant"
par(mar = c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 2.1))
plotellipses(res, axes = 1:2, invisible = c('var', 'quali'), select = drawn, keepvar = hab, title = '', cex = cex)
```

*The labeled individuals are those with the higher contribution to the plane construction.*
*The individuals are coloured after their category for the variable* scolarite_avant.
